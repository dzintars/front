# Shame

This directory should not exist!
If it exist it means we have a refactoring job to do.
Use this directory to store just some rough ideas, concepts... anything which should be refactored into
normal codebase.
Monitor this directory, blame people who are putting stuff in there. Don't let it grow!
Throw away dead code.
As i said... it should not exist! But in reality, when we are prototyping something, we need to style it.
We have no clear vision, how would we like to style it, name the classes or whatever... so this is the
sandbox to play in. But it's really easy to forget to clean up our temporary mess and that will lead
to bigger issues later.
