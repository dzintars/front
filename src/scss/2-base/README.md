# Base styles

- Element selectors
- CSS Reset
- Normalize

All the resets and base styles for all html elements. Body, H1, H2, a, etc.

Base SHOULD NOT contain ANY class names. Only plain html elements.

Keep base styles minimal.
Probably you don't need an Reset or Normalize. If you can delete it and nothing changes, then you don't need that extra code.

Remove margin, padding from form, body.
Set default background color for body.

> Every occurrence of this "paragraph or heading" should always look like this.
