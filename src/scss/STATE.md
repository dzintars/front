# State

- Like a module variation (sub-module), but indicate a JavaScript dependency

State is something that could change the Module or the Layout.
Generally you are not applying state to the base elements.

Examples

- Button:hover
- button:"click"

Active state
Default state - is an actual module
Disabled state

Mostly cooperates with JavaScript which sets the module state.

Pagination - indications of the first or the last page.
